vmmlib
======

A header-only templatized C++ vector and matrix math library.

Its basic functionality includes a vector and a matrix class, with additional functionality for the often-used 3d and 4d vectors and 3x3 and 4x4 matrices.
More advanced features include solvers, frustum computations and frustum culling classes, and spatial data structures.

Vmmlib is implemented using C++ templates, making it versatile. Being a header library, it is very easy to integrate into other (your) libraries and programs. There is no need to build and install a library, just include the headers and youâ€™re set. The BSD license allows the usage both in open source and commercial closed source software.
